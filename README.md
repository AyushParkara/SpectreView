## 🛠 Example Use Case

This userscript enhances your web browsing experience with **privacy-focused redirections and seamless content access**, helping you view public content **without login interruptions**.

* 🔁 **Twitter (`x.com`)**
  Automatically hides login prompts and overlays, allowing you to read tweets and explore profiles without being signed in.

* 🔓 **Instagram**
  Bypasses the login wall when viewing public profiles or posts, so you can scroll freely without interruption.

* 🧵 **Reddit**
  Removes the "Join Reddit" banner and login popup, letting you read threads, comments, and posts without an account.

* ❓ **Quora**
  Disables the "Continue Reading" overlay and blur effect so you can view full answers without needing to log in.

* 📚 **Medium**
  Automatically redirects premium article links to [archive.is](https://archive.is), giving you full access to public posts without encountering paywalls.

These features run silently in the background after installation — no buttons, no toggles, no fuss.
