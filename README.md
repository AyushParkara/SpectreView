## 🛠 Example Use Case

This userscript enhances your web browsing experience with privacy-focused redirections and content access:

- 🔁 Automatically redirects `x.com` (Twitter) links to [nitter.net](https://nitter.net) — a privacy-respecting frontend.
- 📚 Opens Medium premium articles for free using [archive.is](https://archive.is).
- 🔓 Allows you to view public Instagram profiles without logging in by bypassing the login wall.

These features work automatically in the background once the script is installed — no need to click anything!
